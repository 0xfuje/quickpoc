# quickpoc

easy POC template generation from the command line

## features

from the command line, call `quickpoc 0x.. [folder_name]` to generate a ready-to-go sandbox for running POCs for the given address against mainnet, including:

- forge template with name mirroring contract name
- `src/` folder populated with all contracts and libraries
- test file autogenerated with contract import
- test setup with contract variable and mainnet forking
- `cd folder_name` copied to clipboard to save you 1 extra second

you can run `forge test` to confirm it's working, then go into `tests/POC.t.sol` to interact with the contract (saved in storage as `c`).

## install

0) on a UNIX machine with bash installed, install all dependencies:
- foundry ([follow instructions here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry))
- jq (`brew install jq`)

1) clone this repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zobront/quickpoc.git
```

2) set up two environment variables by calling the following from your terminal:
- `export ETH_RPC_URL="..."`
- `export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="..."`

4) add quickpoc to your path so it can be called from the command line:
- `mkdir ~/.quickpoc && mkdir ~/.quickpoc/bin`
- from within the cloned repo: `cp quickpoc ~/.quickpoc/bin/quickpoc`
- open your bash run control file (for example, `~/.zshrc`) and add the following line: `export PATH="$PATH:/Users/{your_name}/.quickpoc/bin`
- call `chmod +x ~/.quickpoc/bin/quickpoc` to make the file executable
- you should then be able to call `quickpoc 0x..` from any folder to generate the POC folder within it.
